# 🛡️ Cloud-Native Cybersecurity Engineer

I’m a cybersecurity engineer specializing in **Cloud Security Architecture**, **Security Automation / DevSecOps (IaC)**, **IAM / Zero Trust**, **SIEM & Analytics**, and **GRC & Compliance Engineering**. My focus is on building secure, automated, auditable environments across hybrid and multi-cloud systems using tools like **Terraform**, **Microsoft Sentinel**, **AWS Security Hub**, **Entra ID**, and more.

With a background in full-stack IT and experience as the sole IT and security owner for a remote-first company, I’ve architected, deployed, and operationalized cloud-native security programs from the ground up. This portfolio provides a holistic view of my work, impact, and the secure-by-design systems I continue to build.

- **Cloud Security Engineering & Architecture**  
  Designing secure infrastructure across Azure and AWS using IaC, Zero Trust, and security-first architecture patterns.

- **Security Automation / DevSecOps (IaC)**  
  Automating everything from asset deployment to compliance validation using Terraform, pipelines, and policy-as-code.

- **IAM / Zero Trust Engineering**  
  Implementing fine-grained access control using Entra ID, Identity360, conditional access, SCIM/JIT provisioning, and MFA.

- **SIEM / Security Analytics Engineering**  
  Building advanced detection rules, transforming telemetry, and visualizing signals using Microsoft Sentinel and AWS tools.

- **GRC & Compliance Engineering**  
  Mapping NIST 800-53, CIS, and ISO 27001 controls to real infrastructure; automating compliance scoring and reporting.
