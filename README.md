## 🛡️Secure Platform Architect | Cybersecurity & Cloud Engineer
I am a cybersecurity engineer and architect specializing in Cloud Security Architecture, Security Automation / DevSecOps (IaC), IAM / Zero Trust, SIEM & Analytics, and GRC & Compliance Engineering. My focus is on building secure, automated, auditable environments across hybrid and multi-cloud systems using tools like Microsoft Sentinel, Microsoft Defender Portal, Terraform, AWS Security Hub, Entra ID, and more.

## About Me
With a background in full-stack IT and comprehensive experience as the lead IT and security professional for a remote-first company, I’ve architected, deployed, and operationalized cloud-native security programs from the ground up. I am a dedicated problem solver who designs and builds elegant security platforms from scratch. This portfolio provides a holistic view of my work, impact, and the secure-by-design systems I continue to build.

## ⚙️ What I Do
 * Cloud Security Engineering & Architecture
   Designing and deploying secure infrastructure across Azure and AWS using IaC, Zero Trust, and security-first architecture patterns.
 * Security Automation / DevSecOps (IaC)
   Automating everything from asset deployment to compliance validation using Terraform, pipelines, and policy-as-code.
 * IAM / Zero Trust Engineering
   Implementing fine-grained access control using Entra ID, Identity360, Conditional Access, SCIM/JIT provisioning, and MFA.
 * SIEM / Security Analytics Engineering
   Building advanced detection rules, transforming telemetry, and visualizing signals using Microsoft Sentinel and AWS tools.
 * GRC & Compliance Engineering
   Mapping NIST-CSF, CIS, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, SOX controls to real infrastructure; automating compliance scoring and reporting.

## 📊 My Cybersecurity Focus Areas
I operate at the convergence of three key disciplines:
 * Security Engineering: Designing and implementing robust security controls and architectures.
 * Platform & Software Development: Building automated solutions with code and managing the CI/CD pipeline.
 * IT & Cloud Infrastructure: Operating and maintaining foundational IT systems across on-premises and multi-cloud environments.

## 🚧 Projects & Case Studies

**🧱 Hybrid Multi-Cloud Zero Trust Architecture with Lean SOC**

End-to-end design and deployment of a federated identity-first, Zero Trust model across Azure, AWS, on-premises, and SaaS. Integrated SIEM, IAM, and a secure VPN (with an on-premise IDS/IPS router).

 * 📎View Architecture Case Study

**📡 Network Detection & Response (NDR): Zeek + Suricata**
Designed and deployed a production-grade NDR pipeline using Zeek (network metadata) and Suricata (deep packet inspection), integrated with Azure Log Analytics. Applied KQL transforms, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and threat enrichment.

**📊 SIEM Engineering with Microsoft Sentinel + HITL-SOAR**
Developed custom analytics rules, threat hunting queries, and incident response playbooks using Microsoft Sentinel. Includes Sentinel Investigation Graphs and real-world incident correlation.
Human-in-the-loop SOAR integrated with Logic Apps.

**⚙️ Centralized Identity Federation for Zero Trust**
Federated IAM across Entra ID, AWS IAM Identity Center, Zoho Identity360, and on-prem AD. Automated provisioning (SCIM), MFA, and Conditional Access policies supporting Zero Trust posture.

** 🧱 Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for Secure Cloud**
Terraform modules with embedded security controls—NSGs, IAM roles, encrypted volumes. Includes CI/CD security gates using GitHub Actions, CodeQL, and automated deployments to AWS and Azure.

**📦 ObsidianWall (Security Infrastructure-as-Code Platform)**
An ongoing project building a dedicated SIaC platform for secure-by-default, multi-cloud infrastructure. Modular blueprints, audit-ready design, and embedded Zero Trust policies—geared for modern, compliance-driven environments.
